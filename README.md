Hello Dear Reader,

In this readme file it's provided what the  goal of the project is in short with some notes.
The project main goal is to detect a DDos attack based upon the network traffic data.
The codes contains data anaylisis, prepreocessing and the training of different models.

This project was a pretty basic ML project for the lesson CENG459 - Data Mining.



Extra from ilyas (contrubutor):
Eventhough myself have experience on AI and training models. This lesson has 
great impact and shown me that i need to study a lot hareder and that i need
to refresh my theorical knowledge. I will always see this lesson as the greatets
contrubution to my AI path yet as i learned a lot about ML and myself.

Special Thanks to our Professor Resul Tugay as he was our lecturer and has 
teach me a lot.
